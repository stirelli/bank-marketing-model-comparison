## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build and evaluate predictive models to determine the likelihood of clients subscribing to a term deposit. By identifying high-potential clients, the bank can enhance campaign efficiency, saving resources and improving conversion rates. The primary success metrics are accuracy and ROC-AUC, given the class imbalance in the dataset.

## Project Objectives
1. **Data Exploration**: Understand the dataset through summary statistics and visualizations, with a focus on identifying key features and potential relationships with the target variable.
2. **Baseline Model**: Establish a baseline performance to set a minimum performance benchmark.
3. **Model Building**: Implement four different classifiers (Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, and SVM) with default hyperparameters.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Compare models based on accuracy and ROC-AUC metrics using cross-validation.
5. **Model Improvement**: Refine models by exploring additional feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and adjusting evaluation metrics to enhance performance.
6. **Feature Analysis**: Identify key features contributing to subscription likelihood and provide actionable recommendations based on feature insights.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualized feature distributions and calculated the correlation matrix to identify relationships between variables.
3. **Modeling**:
   - Created and evaluated a baseline model.
   - Built and compared four machine learning models: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, and Support Vector Machine.
4. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - **Accuracy**: To gauge general predictive power.
   - **ROC-AUC**: To handle the class imbalance effectively, highlighting the modelâ€™s capability to distinguish between positive and negative cases.

## Findings and Recommendations

### Key Findings
- **Top Features**: The most influential features in predicting subscription likelihood included:
   - **Employment Variation Rate**: Reflects economic stability, likely impacting clients' financial decision-making.
   - **Consumer Price Index**: Indicates inflation, potentially affecting clients' willingness to invest.
   - **Days Since Last Contact**: More recent client interactions increase conversion likelihood, as clients tend to respond more favorably when a campaign is recent.
   - **Euribor 3-month Rate**: Serves as a broad economic indicator, influencing client decisions based on overall financial conditions.
   - **Contact Method**: Certain methods, like telephone contact, may be more effective in engaging clients due to the personal connection it fosters.

- **Model Performance**:
   - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: The SVM model showed training accuracy of 0.6929 and test accuracy of 0.6964, with a ROC-AUC of 0.7670, indicating moderate effectiveness. However, it struggled with a high rate of False Positives, which could result in wasted resources on clients less likely to convert.
   - **Decision Tree**: This model achieved high accuracy (training: 0.9014, test: 0.9000) with a ROC-AUC of 0.8002. It excelled in identifying the negative class but had a significant number of False Negatives, which could lead to missed opportunities to target potential subscribers.
   - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: KNN demonstrated strong accuracy (training: 0.9047, test: 0.8990) but with a lower ROC-AUC of 0.7682, reflecting moderate performance in distinguishing classes. The high False Negative rate suggests it may not be ideal for accurately identifying likely subscribers.
   - **Logistic Regression**: Logistic Regression achieved stable accuracy (training: 0.8990, test: 0.9009) and a ROC-AUC of 0.7974. Although it provided balanced classification results, a moderate rate of False Negatives indicates that additional tuning could further improve its ability to identify potential subscribers.

- **Baseline Comparison**: All models outperformed the baseline model, confirming predictive capability above random chance. This indicates that each model provides valuable insights, forming a foundation for further optimization to enhance the identification of likely subscribers.

### Recommendations
- **Targeting Strategy**: Focus campaigns on clients recently contacted, as they are more likely to respond positively to the campaign. Timing campaigns during economically favorable periods can also improve engagement and conversion.
- **Timing and Economic Indicators**: Leverage indicators like employment rates and consumer price indexes to optimize campaign timing, aligning efforts with periods of high economic stability to maximize conversion potential.
- **Personalization**: Offer personalized products to clients with uncertain economic indicators, as they may benefit from customized options that align with their current financial situation, potentially improving subscription rates.

## Next Steps
1. **Further Hyperparameter Tuning**: While initial hyperparameter tuning has been performed, additional exploration of the parameter space may yield further performance gains.
2. **Enhanced Feature Engineering**: Continue exploring additional interactions or transformations to better capture complex relationships in the data.
3. **Deployment and Monitoring**: Deploy the refined model and set up monitoring to track real-world performance over time, ensuring alignment with business objectives.
