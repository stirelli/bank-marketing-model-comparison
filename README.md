## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build and evaluate predictive models to determine the likelihood of clients subscribing to a term deposit. By identifying high-potential clients, the bank can enhance campaign efficiency, saving resources and improving conversion rates. The primary success metrics are accuracy and ROC-AUC, given the class imbalance in the dataset.

## Project Objectives
1. **Data Exploration**: Understand the dataset through summary statistics and visualizations, with a focus on identifying key features and potential relationships with the target variable.
2. **Baseline Model**: Establish a baseline performance using a `DummyClassifier` to set a minimum performance benchmark.
3. **Model Building**: Implement four different classifiers (Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, and SVM) with default hyperparameters.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Compare models based on accuracy and ROC-AUC metrics using cross-validation.
5. **Feature Analysis**: Identify key features contributing to subscription likelihood and provide actionable recommendations based on feature insights.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualized feature distributions and calculated the correlation matrix to identify relationships between variables.
3. **Modeling**:
   - Created and evaluated a baseline model using a stratified `DummyClassifier`.
   - Built and compared four machine learning models: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, and Support Vector Machine.
4. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - **Accuracy**: To gauge general predictive power.
   - **ROC-AUC**: To handle the class imbalance effectively, highlighting the modelâ€™s capability to distinguish between positive and negative cases.

## Findings and Recommendations
### Key Findings
- **Top Features**: Employment variation rate, consumer price index, days since last contact, Euribor 3-month rate, and contact method emerged as influential factors.
- **Model Performance**: SVM demonstrated the best balance between accuracy and ROC-AUC, making it a top candidate for further optimization.
- **Baseline Comparison**: All models outperformed the baseline, confirming predictive capability above random chance.

### Recommendations
- **Targeting Strategy**: Focus campaigns on clients recently contacted, especially during economically favorable periods.
- **Timing and Economic Indicators**: Leverage indicators like employment rates and consumer price indexes to align campaign timing with high conversion potential.
- **Personalization**: Offer personalized products to clients with uncertain economic indicators to improve subscription rates.

## Next Steps
1. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Fine-tune models to potentially improve performance.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Explore additional interactions or transformations to capture complex relationships in the data.
3. **Deployment and Monitoring**: Deploy the chosen model and set up a system to monitor performance over time, ensuring it continues to meet business goals.
